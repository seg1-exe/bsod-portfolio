            <h3>Argenteurs is a collective of silver-based photographers from the south of France. <br>Through their photos, they convey their roots, their relationship to those who keep their skills alive to light, warmth and color. </h2>

            <h3>Through two photo collections, they were able to convey their visions of the South, rural life and music.<br><br>And thanks to their website, they were able to share their vision with France and the world.</h2>

            <h3>In November 2024, they are organizing an event combining photography and music with “South in Paris”. A photo exhibition of their collection and concerts and djsets by artists from the south of France. It was after this event that I decided to rework their website in my own way.</h2>

            <h3>I decided to highlight orange, a dominant color in their photographs and posters, with a black background for a striking contrast. I kept the header of the homepage fairly uncluttered so as not to lose the user. To recall the rural side they convey through their work, I preferred to use “La Gazette” rather than a “News” section. Finally, the navigation bar is light, so that only the most important elements remain: the photo gallery, the latest events and a contact page.</h2>

            <h3>The page to commemorate the “South in Paris” collection and the event of the same name remains very simplistic to highlight the multimedia work put in place for this event. The first video teases the event and whets our appetite for the photo collection. A selection of photos recounting the music event. And finally, a summary video to bring you back up to date.</h2>
